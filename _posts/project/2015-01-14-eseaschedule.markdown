####ESEA Schedule
ESEA Schedule is a website which pulls info about matches from the ESEA website and displays it in a different format. The website allows for filtering by a date/time range, region, game, division, and match status, offers the option to hide match results, and provides easy links to match spectate servers, match demo downloads, match detail pages, and team pages. Organizations such as TeamFortress.TV and EVL TV as well as other interested players use this website as a tool in planning match casts and writing analysis and prediction articles.
