####StatusSpec
StatusSpec is a client plugin for Team Fortress 2 designed to enhance the spectator experience. It is composed of several different modules implementing functionality not available in the stock TF2 client. These features (including HUD fixes and additions, camera management tools, and player and team aliasing) have led to StatusSpec become a staple tool for casting competitive matches. StatusSpec is used by  top casting organizations such as TeamFortressTV and eXtelevision and in coverage of some of the the competitive scene's largest events such as the seasonal ESEA LAN finals, annual summer Insomnia gaming festivals, and other major community events.
