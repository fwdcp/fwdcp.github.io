b4nnyBot is a bot designed for b4nny's stream. As a Twitch chat bot, it utilizes APIs for several services to respond with commonly requested info like game ranks, league team info, and Steam status. In addition, it provides a unique broadcast feature which allows info (such as lobby passwords) to be widely distributed to followers on Steam and in Twitch chat, with priority given to subscribers over regular users.
