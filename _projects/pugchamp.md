PugChamp is the framework behind an eponymous [PUG service](http://pug.champ.gg) run by [ChampGG](http://champ.gg). From its inception, PugChamp has brought a new level of sophistication to the TF2 scene, with many advanced features like rating systems, self-managed servers, integration with services such as [logs.tf](http://logs.tf) and [demos.tf](http://demos.tf), and a rich captain draft system. This has allowed it to claim the dominant position in PUG services with hundreds of active players on a daily basis.
